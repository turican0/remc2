And I smell the fear of mortal men.#Kafkar: Then you remember that promising apprentice you once introduced to the eldritch arts...#Apprentice: No! Master?#Kafkar: I see you have met your new neighbour, Vissuluth, Demon Lord of the Netherworlds.#"You must explore the outer Netherworlds while you learn its magic. Your first destination is the ancient city of Jahwl."#"Before Vissuluth's rule of the Netherworlds began, the island of Kopahk was occupied by the great sorceress, Payahandra. Go there and discover her lost spells."#"Nyphur is a shapechanger. I will send you to his lair to seek the source of his power. I warn you, he will not have left his domain weakly defended."#"A gift from the gods! Alas, it falls towards the netherworld of the spiders..."#"The outcast, Nyphur, wages war against Rahn The Destructor, in the outer netherworld of T'Klom. Neither is fit to rule."#"Others have entered the Labyrinths of Lost Souls, seeking powers which are said to lie in the netherworld of the undead. I warn you, none has ever returned."#"The way through the Mountains of Perilium is guarded by the three outer guardians, each of whom shares power with the others by possessing one spell that no other has. All are deadly."#"To reach the Black Plains, you must first find your way through the tunnels beneath the mountains. I wonder what Vissuluth has in store for us here."#"The manticores of the Black Plains are ruled and hunted by Jark the Hunter, Lord of the Middle Netherworlds. Now he defends his secret lore from your defeated adversaries."#"The greatest challenge of your journey awaits you in the jagged wastes of Cymmeria. Guard your castle well, wizard."#"You must cross the Cymmerian Sea, home of the leviathan. Beware that which lurks beneath the waves."#"Centuries ago, the Demon Lord entombed an army of wizards that had risen against him. Forever trapped in giant stone faces, they are known as the sentinels. It would be best to avoid disturbing them when you make your way through these tunnels."#"The once beautiful netherworld of Galiphur is being ravaged by the war between the wizard lords you have displaced. Yet, by fighting among themselves, they make easier prey for you."#"You must return to the underworld soon. But the way to the netherworld you seek has been lost in the violent eruptions of the Fire Peaks."#"Beneath you lies the underground netherworld of Zyggogg. From this place, Vissuluth selects the strongest creatures to join his army. It is time to deal our adversary a truly serious blow."#"You must find out where the troglodytes are coming from and find a way to stop them. I suspect the deep netherworld of Darklava, mining civilisation of the ancient ones."#"The Arenas of the C'lannesh are infamous across the netherworlds, for the deadly sport which they provide. Your enemies have called on the Elyssia the Trainer for aid. She will see how well you have learned your skills."#"The Wyvernflights of The Firestorm Mountains are commanded by Yragore, one of the most powerful wizards to serve the Demon Lord. Yet a rival of Yragore stole the spell of creature command. The thief perished but Yragore does not know what happened to the spell."#"You have brought chaos to the Demon Lord's domain. His wizards regroup in the wilderness below."#"The people have nowhere to run to, nor any place to hide. And Vissuluth has turned his army on them. We must go to the aid of the innocent."#"Nyphur's armies return. They gather here, in a maze of tunnels and unstable caverns. You must enter tunnels and hunt down the enemy."#"We are nearing Vissuluth's Citadel. On the other side of Valley of the Hydra is Jathnar, the capital city. I am certain that the valley beyond will be suitably defended. Take care, master wizard."#"Dawn rises over the City of Jathnar, the iniquitous den from which the lackeys of the Demon Lord do his bidding. Leave nothing standing here. Let nothing live."#"Vissuluth's Citadel generates a shield which none of your spells can penetrate. But the catacombs beneath the ruins of Jathnar should still provide a way."#"You found the way. I have asked so much and you have never faltered. But you must be ready to use everything you have learned in the battle ahead, for you have reached the citadel. And Vissuluth has returned."#"Fly towards my beacon."#"Follow the path to the foot of the spire. There you will find a spell jar."#"These archers guard a spell jar. They must be vanquished."#"Build the strongest castle you can and fill it with mana."#"These fireflies are lethal. Destroy them."#"The city of Jahwl is safe for now. Come, there is much more to do."#"Seek my sign. There is a spell near there which will find out your enemies."#"Beware! Nyphur, a servant of the Demon Lord, will try to kill you. You will have to banish him from the netherworld."#"Kill the giant bees that plague the people."#"Good work! Quickly, go to the ruins of Payahandra's tower."#"Payahandra's spells are hidden inside these vaults. Raze them to the ground."#"When you have recovered the spells, make your way to the portal. Your work here is done."#"The people of Nyphur's netherworld are doomed to swell the ranks of his army of undead, unless you slay the skeleton horde."#"You must defeat Nyphur's guardian dragons."#"The entrance only reveals itself to the most powerful wizards."#"Behold the way! Quickly, my friend."#"Despatch this evil!"#"Take the secret of the shapechangers and let us begone."#"You must find the star that fell."#"This is a good time to attack the spiders But beware their webs."#"Once more, your determination proves its worth. Make your way to the portal. We must press on."#"Rahn is weaker. Challenge him and banish him."#"Defend yourself against Nyphur."#"I hope your taste for victory over Vissuluth's lieutenants is not yet sated. Already they plan their revenge."#"Send this creature to the grave where it belongs."#"I fear you have attracted some unwanted attention."#"There must be a way out of this cave. Look for a hidden sign."#"Defend yourself. Now is not the time to fade into legend."#"Get out of here! Get out while you can!"#"To win, you must fight like a demon yourself."#"I knew you had the strength. Now it is time to depart this forsaken place."#"The fiend has sprung a trap! Fight, wizard, fight!"#"Follow my sign. I will try to find a way."#"Is there no end to this rock?"#"These zombies guard a hidden way."#"So, Vissuluth is building an army of devils, is he? You can foil that plan, my friend."#"The devils built these structures to block the portal to the Black Plains. Obliterate them."#"You can now return to the surface."#"A manticore comes this way. It can smell an intruder."#"Finish it!"#"Destroy Jark."#"Jark's Loretower is revealed to us. His ancient secret lies within."#"This is your hunting ground now. Make sure no manticore ever leaves this netherworld."#"Every one of the beasts has perished. Nothing remains for a wizard to rule!"#"Vissuluth's army maintains barracks here. Send them crashing to the feet of the mountains."#"The black winged swarm finally emerges."#"The Cymmerians have sealed the portal. Travel to the ruined temple. Perhaps the gods may help us again."#"The gods do not speak to me. If you become more powerful the way may be revealed to you."#"Indeed, the gods are watching you."#"Navigate by my sign. The storm will hide you."#"You have discovered Yujan, the lost city of devils. You must destroy this place."#"Wipe out every trace of this evil plague."#"Ah! This spell will prove useful against Vissuluth's wizards."#"This has been a profitable stage of your journey."#"These tunnels all return on each other. You must find a way to blast out."#"Your stamina has impressed the gods. This spell is your reward."#"It is time to leave this place."#"The battle goes badly for Nyphur. His mana could easily be yours."#"I think it's time for Rahn to pay for his crimes."#"Attack Belix the Pitiless, scourge of the outer netherworlds!"#"Only Jark stands in your way now."#"As convincing a display of sorcerous skills as I have ever beheld."#"Even here, humans strive for survival. Give them hope by keeping at bay the evil that has taunted them for so long."#"The chiefs of the Fire Peaks tribes pray that you can save them from the terror of the moon dwellers."#"If we cannot help the people here, those back in your world are doomed."#"Ye gods, behold! Coming from the sea!"#"I hope you remember who taught you the sorcerer's way. Hurry, time is our enemy."#"Exterminate them all!"#"Vissuluth has found some new allies. What they are and where they come from, I do not know."#"I fear our task may be too great. Yet we have no choice but to try."#"Vissuluth has re-opened the mines. Destroy this outpost. We must get inside."#"Those sentinels guard the way."#"A little more rubble here for you."#"Quickly, to the mines. Destroy the smelting houses."#"Fiends! Blast them!"#"Let us leave what remains of Darklava in peace."#"Give these evil doers a display of real wizardry!"#"Soon you will have finished them for good."#"Yragore is extremely powerful, do not attack him until you are ready."#"Beware! A wyvern approaches!"#"Your battle with the wyvern will attract more of its kind. Be ready."#"Now, command the wyvern and attack Yragore's castle!"#"Your foe surely fears you now."#"Battle is joined! Success, my friend!"#"You triumph at last."#"Protect the people. Rid the netherworld of the Demon Lord's twisted creations."#"He has summoned a hydra! Destroy the beast before it lays waste to the entire netherworld."#I" fear there will more of these creatures to slay before your journey is done."#"These caverns are infested! Make this place the tomb of the troglodytes."#"Beyond lies the zombie horde. Now is your chance."#"Nyphur is more powerful than he has ever been. Can you force him to retreat again?"#"I still sense evil. Do not dally here."#"You have been discovered!"#"Gain all the strength you can while there's time. Tomorrow we fly to Jathnar."#"Night is almost over. You make good time."#"Destroy the War Council Tower."#"Good. Now reduce the barracks to rubble."#"Make sure that not one spell ever leaves Vissuluth's apothecary again."#"Bring down this temple of evil."#"Smash the weapons vaults."#"Now destroy the seven wizard lords! This time they will perish."#"Cleanse the netherworld of the evil spawn."#"Enough! The catacombs beckon you."#"This chamber appears to have been a temple."#"We have incurred the wrath of the faithful. Let us settle this here."#"Find out what now lies before us."#"This is some kind of device."#"On guard, mage. The foe is upon you."#"Do not tire, my friend.

Kill them!#Burn their cities to the ground! And as their armies fall before us,#let them rise again as slaves of darkness.#Heed my call, winged legions of Cymmeria. The time has come when the skies of man are#filled with your kind. Leave your mountain haunts and follow the march of chaos.#Let the beating of your wings carry this message to the world:#Despair and bow down before your new God, Vissuluth.#I summon the demons who dwell beyond the sky. Gather mana for me, cold nameless ones.#Strike my enemies down with lightning. Come! I command you to do my bidding.#My patience is exhausted. From Mount Firestorm, let the wyvernflights ride.#Seek out the cities of man and blast them from the face from the world.#Crush them once and for all!#Who is this who would thwart my plans?
