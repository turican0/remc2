No-nonsense patches for YM2612.


== About ==

After much work on my DMXOPL project, I noticed that a lot of presets that
I created were not compatible with the YM2612, which was the chip I started
with, but quickly dropped. In response, I decided to rectify this by recreating
the best patches from DMXOPL to OPN2 format. Don't expect miracles, as this is
more of a learning experience so I can start working on expanding my FM synth
knowledge.

I chose the name "DMX" not because it works with DMX, but that it will
(hopefully) be of the same quality as the DMXOPL patch. Yeah, not very
descriptive, but names aren't everything.

Watch this space.
