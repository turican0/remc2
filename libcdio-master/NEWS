          type 4.

  which are guaranteed to be in UTF-8, are returned as a new type
  cdio_utf8_t, which is typedef'd to char.

version 0.77
=====================================
2006-03-17

- block read routines return success if asked to read 0 blocks.

- Start UDF handling

- increase use of enumerations more and decrease use of #defines

- OS Support:
    DragonFly recognized as FreeBSD,
    MinGW better tolerated,
    GNU/Linux (and others?) LARGEFILE support
    OpenBSD tested (no native CD driver though)

- Doxygen formatting improvements.

- Misc bugs:
  * fixed bincue driver caused core dump on set_speed and
    set_blocksize; it also called the wrong routine (from NRG) to get a
    list of cd-images.
  * read.h didn't make sure off_t was defined.
  * fixed bug in is_device() when driver_id = DRIVER_UNKNOWN or DRIVER_DEVICE.
  * OSX was freeing too much in listing drives.
  * get_hwinfo was not respecting fixed-length field boundaries in
    image drivers (strcpy->strncpy).
  * A number ISO 9660 time conversion routines corrected with respect to
    various timezone offsets, daylight savings time, and tm capabilities

- small cdda-player improvements - shows more CD-TEXT, and fix bug in
  non-interactive use (Yes, I sometimes use it.)

- NRG checking parses file. string tests were invalid on short < 4
  character filenames.

- Revise and improve example programs

- Security: replace all uses of strcat and strcpy with strncat and strncpy

- Allow building cd-paranoia if Perl is not installed.

- More accurate library dependency tracking in linking and pkg-config

- Miscellaneous minor bug fixes.

- cdio/cdda.h headers no longer depends on cdio/paranoia.h but vice versa
  is true. This may require an #include <cdio/cdda.h> in some applications that
  used <cdio/paranoia.h> but didn't include it.
