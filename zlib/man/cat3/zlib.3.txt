ZLIB(3)                                                 ZLIB(3)





NAME
       zlib - compression/decompression library

SYNOPSIS
       [see zlib.h for full description]

DESCRIPTION
       The  zlib  library is a general purpose data compression
       library.  The code is thread safe.  It provides  in-mem-
       ory  compression  and decompression functions, including
       integrity checks of the uncompressed data.  This version
       of  the  library  supports  only  one compression method
       (deflation) but other algorithms will be added later and
       will have the same stream interface.

       Compression  can be done in a single step if the buffers
       are large enough  (for  example  if  an  input  file  is
       mmap'ed),  or  can be done by repeated calls of the com-
       pression function.  In the latter case, the  application
       must  provide more input and/or consume the output (pro-
       viding more output space) before each call.

       The library also supports reading and writing  files  in
       gzip(1)  (.gz)  format with an interface similar to that
       of stdio.

       The library does not install any  signal  handler.   The
       decoder  checks  the consistency of the compressed data,
       so the library should never crash even in case  of  cor-
       rupted input.

       All  functions of the compression library are documented
       in the file zlib.h.  The  distribution  source  includes
       examples  of  use  of the library in the files example.c
       and minigzip.c.

       Changes to this  version  are  documented  in  the  file
       ChangeLog that accompanies the source, and are concerned
       primarily with bug fixes and portability enhancements.

       A Java implementation of zlib is available in  the  Java
       Development Kit 1.1:

              ucts/JDK/1.1/docs/api/Package-java.util.zip.html

       A Perl interface  to  zlib,  written  by  Paul  Marquess
       (pmqs@cpan.org),  is  available  at  CPAN (Comprehensive
       Perl Archive Network) sites, including:

       A Python interface to zlib,  written  by  A.M.  Kuchling
       (amk@magnet.com),  is  available in Python 1.5 and later
       versions:

       A zlib binding for tcl(1), written  by  Andreas  Kupries
       (a.kupries@westend.com), is availlable at:

       An experimental package to read and write files in  .zip
       format,  written  on  top  of  zlib  by  Gilles  Vollant
       (info@winimage.com), is available at:

              http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html    and
              also in the contrib/minizip directory of the main
              zlib web site.

       The data format used by the zlib library is described by
       RFC (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files:

              http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt   (concerning
              zlib format)
              http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt   (concerning
              deflate format)
              http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt   (concerning
              gzip format)

REPORTING PROBLEMS
       Before reporting a problem, please check  the  zlib  web
       site to verify that you have the latest version of zlib;
       otherwise, obtain the latest  version  and  see  if  the
       problem still exists.  Please read the zlib FAQ at:

              http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_faq.html

       before  asking for help.  Send questions and/or comments
       to zlib@gzip.org, or (for the Windows  DLL  version)  to
       Gilles Vollant (info@winimage.com).
